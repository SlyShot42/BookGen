It applies to flows that are **inviscid** (no viscosity), **incompressible**, and **irrotational**. These assumptions allow the governing equations of motion to be significantly simplified, enabling analytical solutions to many classical problems in fluid mechanics.\\n\\nThe starting point for potential flow theory is the recognition that an irrotational velocity field can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential function $\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x},t)$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\nabla \\\\phi\\n$$\\n\\nHere, $\\\\mathbf{v}$ denotes the velocity vector field, and the potential function $\\\\phi$ encodes all information about the flow. The irrotational condition is given by:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\nabla \\\\times (\\\\nabla \\\\phi) = \\\\mathbf{0}\\n$$\\n\\nwhich is identically satisfied for any sufficiently smooth scalar function $\\\\phi$.\\n\\nUnder incompressibility, the continuity equation for mass conservation simplifies to:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\nabla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v} = 0\\n$$\\n\\nSubstituting $\\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\nabla \\\\phi$ into the above yields:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\nabla^2 \\\\phi = 0\\n$$\\n\\nThus, the scalar potential $\\\\phi$ is a solution of **Laplace's equation**. This connection to classical potential theory in mathematical physics allows the techniques of harmonic functions, boundary value problems, and conformal mapping to be applied to fluid flows.\\n\\nBecause Laplace's equation is linear, potential flow theory benefits from the principle of superposition. That is, if $\\\\phi_1$ and $\\\\phi_2$ are solutions, then $\\\\phi = \\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi_2$ is also a valid solution. This property is exploited to construct complex flows by adding elementary potential flows such as uniform flows, sources and sinks, doublets, and vortices (in a potential sense, when circulation is introduced).\\n\\nThe physical interpretation of these basic elements is straightforward:\\n\\n- **Uniform flow**: a constant velocity everywhere, $\\\\phi = Ux$ for flow in the $x$-direction.\\n- **Source (or sink)**: radial outflow (or inflow) from a point; the potential for a source of strength $Q$ at the origin in two dimensions is $\\\\phi = \\\\frac{Q}{2\\\\pi} \\\\ln r$.\\n- **Doublet**: a limiting case of a source and sink pair in close proximity, producing flow patterns around objects.\\n- **Vortex element**: though strictly rotational, vortex flow can be combined with potential flow solutions to model circulation.\\n\\nBy superimposing these elementary solutions, potential flow theory can approximate flows around immersed bodies, such as cylinders or aerofoils, subject to appropriate boundary conditions. The **no-penetration boundary condition** is applied on the surface of solid bodies:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n} = 0\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{n}$ is the normal to the surface, ensuring that the idealized fluid does not permeate the material boundary.\\n\\nThe dynamic behavior of potential flows can also be connected to pressure distributions through **Bernoulli's equation** for unsteady, irrotational flows:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2} |\\\\nabla \\\\phi|^2 + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} + gz = f(t)\\n$$\\n\\nHere, $p$ denotes pressure, $\\\\rho$ the fluid density, $g$ the gravitational acceleration, and $f(t)$ an arbitrary function of time determined by reference conditions. This equation links the velocity potential directly to measurable quantities such as pressure.\\n\\nDespite its simplifying assumptions, potential flow theory has broad applicability in aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and electrostatics analogies. It accurately predicts the outer (inviscid) flow field around streamlined bodies and is foundational in the mathematical analysis of wave motion, free-surface flows, and certain compressible flows under isentropic conditions.\\n\\nHowever, potential flow theory neglects viscous effects, making it unsuitable for describing boundary layers, flow separation, and turbulence. In practice, it is often employed in conjunction with boundary layer theory to obtain a more complete description of real-world fluid motion. The elegance of its mathematical structure and its connection to harmonic functions makes it a cornerstone in theoretical fluid dynamics and mathematical physics.\"}",
